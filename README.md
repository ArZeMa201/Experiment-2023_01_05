## FBG sensor description 
12 FBG sensor array embedded in silicone rubber 
In this experiment, even though a 12-sensor array was embedded only 9 were used. Being discarded Lambda 1, 2, and 8.
Here are the Lambda values of each FBG sensor: 
- Lambda 1 1515.14
- Lambda 2 1519.19
- Lambda 3 1523.19
- Lambda 4 1526.92
- Lambda 5 1530.85
- Lambda 6 1534.63
- Lambda 7 1538.75
- Lambda 8 1542.8
- Lambda 9 1546.79
- Lambda 10 1550.54
- Lambda 11 1554.58
- Lambda 12 1558.41

## Experimetal description
15 repetitions of the experiment were carried out attempting to keep the same conditions, on every iteration.
- The radious of the used profile was of 50mm
- The *y* position of the FBG respect to the neutral axis was of 1mm
- Total hight of the flexible tooling was approximate of 2.3mm
